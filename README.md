# Cornucopia

### Description

Cornucopia is an application created in order to facilitate item donations to non-profit organizations. The non-profit uses a bookmark from the site to download the items they need onto the website with just a click of a button! As a donator, one can peruse the site, filter to the type of non-profit one is most passionate about, and click on a link in order to purchase and send that item to the non-profit organization.

### Technologies Used

1. NodeJS
2. Express
3. PostgreSQL
4. React
5. JavaScript

### Features

1. #### Non-Profit Log-in:

  The non-profits sign-up or log-in and are taken to the bookmark page. 

2. #### Bookmarks/ Wish-List Creator page:

  This is a page that one is redirected to after the log-in or sign-up page. It is only available to non-profits and each bookmarklet is specific to that non-profit id. The bookmarklet can be dragged to the bookmark bar and used in order to send data back to the site. There are directions on how to use the bookmarklet as well as a gif showing one how to use it.

3. #### Donations Page:

  On the donations page, all the items that the non-profits need populate the page and will automatically add the item when a non-profit sends back the data through their bookmarklet. There is also a sorting feature in which one can sort through the type of donations. 

4. #### Donate Feature:

  On the donations page in each item, there is a donate button. For those who wish to donate, they can click the donate button and a modal will tell them the shipping address and name of the non-profit before leaving to the Amazon item page. When one goes back to the Cornucopia site, they are met with another modal that asks if they purchased that particular item and how many they purchased. 

5. #### Non-Profit About Pages:

  To connect to the non-profit about pages, one can click on the non-profit titles and be directed to the individual non-profit's page. 

6. #### About page for the app:

  It is just an about page for the site. 

7. #### Nav Bar:

  The nav bar holds the title of the app which directs the user to the Donations page, an about title which connects to the about page, and the log-in title which changes once a user in signed in.
